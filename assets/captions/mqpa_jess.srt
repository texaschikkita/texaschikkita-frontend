00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Hi, I'm Jessica, but the past year, a bit of a mission to explore how quantum computing

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,160
can change how we understand the environment, our data, and even ourselves.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,840
It started with one big question.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,280
How can we move beyond today's computing limits and create something more evolved?

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,480
That question led me to build MQBA, molecular quantum particle algorithm.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,760
Later, I appeared with a powerful tool called MTQC, multi-target quantum compilation.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,400
I didn't create MTQC, but I adapted it slightly to work with MQBA and make it scalable.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,440
Together, they formed a corva system that blends quantum computing, GIS, molecular modeling,

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
and AI.

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,680
Let's start with the basics.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Classical computers use bits, zeros and ones.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,000
Quantum computers use qubits, zero, one, or built at the same time.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,520
That's called superposition.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,200
There's also entanglement, when two qubits are linked.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,240
Change one and the other reacts instantly, no matter how far apart they are.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,880
These features allow us to solve complex problems faster than classical machines ever could.

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
I applied this to GIS, geographic information systems.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,280
These platforms already pull a massive data from satellites, drones, radar, and sensors.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,280
The classical systems struggle the process quickly, or put it in a real world context-fast enough to act.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,640
Quantum GIS flips the script.

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,200
With quantum tools, I can model storm behavior, trap pollution, and predict environmental changes

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,080
all in real time, and across multiple possible outcomes.

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,320
It's like giving your weather model a quantum brain, one that sees multiple features at once.

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,520
Now let's talk about MQBA.

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,960
It stimulates how model kills scatter, bond, and react to environmental forces.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,320
I didn't run these models in isolation.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,360
I linked them to geography, live terrain, ecosystems, and weather clients.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,200
To scale this up, I used MTQC, a compiler that lets you execute many quantum models in parallel.

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,440
I slightly tweaked it to fit MQBA's needs.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
The classical system handles prep and post-processing.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,040
The quantum layer runs the pattern discovery optimization.

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,120
Grover's algorithm helps locate patterns quickly.

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,240
Thor's helps simplify quantum outlets.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,160
Together, they power a hybrid system for environmental simulation.

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,600
I used Google early on for rapid prototyping.

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,920
It wasn't perfect, but it let me test fast and switch between quantum backends quickly.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,520
My data source was varied.

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,280
I've worked with QM9 for molecular structures, NASA satellite light our data,

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,520
environmental logs, public, physical records,

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,040
pollution data tied to geographic locations.

41
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,600
Each data set that's cleaned classically

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,840
then passed through quantum learning models,

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,200
like quantum classifiers, kernel models, or auto-encodes.

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,880
I pulled the results back to classical space visualization and interpretation.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,800
Interpretation is key.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,080
So I built a GPT-based assistant, my quantum fluent AI.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,760
It reads raw circuit output and explains them in plain English.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,760
When I'm modeling how fossil fuels shift in earthquake,

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,440
or if I'm modeling how rainfall changes urban air chemistry,

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,200
my assistant can make those results clear and usable.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,520
I also post this visually.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,440
I passed MQBA outputs into Blunder to create three demolecular meshes.

53
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,760
Then I processed those model kills using quantum node circuits.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,240
I visualized the behavior of block spheres

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,280
and mapped out entanglements as interactive 3D geometry.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,720
The hardest part?

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
Particle scattering.

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,240
I used a hybrid quantum method to simulate how particle scatter

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,640
without changing the speed.

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,120
Even with hardware noise and decoherence,

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,960
I was able to get useful predictive results.

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,440
So basically I went from tracking storms

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,400
to modeling the birth of model kills.

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,200
Every part of this process blended quantum,

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,920
classical and AI tools to interpret,

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,800
simulate and refine what we see in nature.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,240
The result?

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,000
Real-time pipelines for smarter environmental modeling.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,640
A framework that can be deployed today

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,840
by government defense or research labs.

71
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,840
And now I'm wrapping it into a full AI interface on my site,

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
jessie.chepp.

73
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,320
Right now it's just a project showcase,

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,320
but it's actively becoming a real working tool.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,080
Lots of moving parts.

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,040
Lots and lots of provisioning.

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,320
Lots of moving models back and forth.

78
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,960
And yeah, it's expensive and conversant,

79
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
but it's happening.

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
It's happening now.

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,520
The final version will include GPT,

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,760
BERT, MQPA, MTQC,

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,880
interactive search generators.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Hugging face, transformer models,

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,160
and all the visual quantum tools I've described.

86
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,320
So yeah, it's been quite a year

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,880
and I've just getting started.

88
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Thank you guys so much for listening.

89
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,680
And special thanks to Dr. Vivian Sather,

90
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,360
Dr. Eric Larson, Dr. Jacqueline Chen,

91
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
and Dr. Jessie Zara Zalva for your trust,

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,240
support, and belief in this vision.

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,560
I can't wait to show you guys what's next.

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Let's go make some quantum noise.
